Predicting Innovative Colleges from Patent Production

Motivation: Inventors = pioneers of progress

Policy makers want to create places for ideas to thrive to maximize innovative potential and build the economy.

Recent policy is mostly focused on intervening in children's exposure to innovation. However, research has found that higher education institutions also play an important role in helping students develop innovation competence, not just their exposure at a young age.
Can we predict how innovative a college is through the total number of patents they produce?

To explore our question, we merged multiple datasets from Opportunity Insights.

    Innovation Rates by College
    College Level Characteristics
    Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates by College

Notable potential factors, according to background research, not included in our dataset:

    Internal factors (autonomy, motivation, self-awareness)
    Proportion of elective to core courses
    Quality of faculty
    Metric of evaluation (tests score? projects?)

Notable potential factors, according to background research, included in our dataset:

    Family income/mobility in general and by innovation status
    Makeup of different majors by college (Fine Arts Majors most innovative and Psych Majors least innovative, according to one study)

Data set (after cleaning, before model building): 313 colleges and 124 columns.

Top 3 colleges by total number of patents:

    Stanford University (1309)
    Purdue University (1167)
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1058)

Bottom 3 colleges by total number of patents:

    Davidson College (4)
    Baldwin Wallace University (3)
    Marshall University (0)
